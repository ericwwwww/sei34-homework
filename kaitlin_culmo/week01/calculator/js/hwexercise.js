// # The Calculator
//
// ## Part 1
// - Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."
// - Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".
// - Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."
// - Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172."
// - Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.
//
const squareNumber = function (aNumber) {
  const squaredNumber = (aNumber * aNumber);
  return `The result of squaring the number ${ aNumber } is ${ squaredNumber }`
};

console.log(squareNumber(3));


const halfNumber = function (aNumber) {
  const halfNumber = (aNumber / 2);
  return `Half of ${ aNumber } is ${ halfNumber }`;
};

console.log(halfNumber(5));

//consulted the hw solutions but was initially forming them the same as first two above
function percentOf(num1, num2) {
    var percent = (num1/num2) * 100;
    console.log(num1 + ' is ' + percent + '% of ' + num2);
    return percent;
}

percentOf(3, 10);

function areaOfCircle(radius) {
    var area = Math.PI * squareNumber(radius);
    console.log('The area of circle with radius ' + radius + ' is ' + area);
    return area;
}

areaOfCircle(2);



// ## Part 2
// Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier1:
// - Take half of the number and store the result.
// - Square the result of #1 and store that result.
// - Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
// - Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).

// totally need help on this
